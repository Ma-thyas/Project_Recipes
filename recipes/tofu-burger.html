        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Easy and healthy tofu-based veggie burger.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350 g firm silken tofu</li>
            <li>1 large free-range egg</li>
            <li>75 g wholemeal breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 heaped teaspoons Marmite</li>
            <li>8 ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of fresh basil</li>
            <li>4 soft wholemeal buns</li>
            <li>400 g mixed seasonal salad veg, such as cucumber, red cabbage, apples, cress, baby spinach</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>50 g Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>50 g gherkins</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <p >Creamy Basil Dressing</p>
            <li>4 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>4 sprigs of fresh basil</li>
            <li>¼ of a fresh red chilli</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wrap the tofu in a clean tea towel, then squeeze and wring it out to remove the excess liquid (about 4 tablespoons should come out – it’s messy, but really important to do this for great burger texture later).</li>
            <li>Place the tofu in a bowl, scraping it off the tea towel. Crack in the egg, then add the breadcrumbs and Marmite. Mix and scrunch together really well with clean hands, then shape into 4 even-sized patties that’ll fit nicely in your buns once cooked.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the tomatoes and put into a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat with a pinch of black pepper, a splash of water and the vinegar.</li>
            <li>Squash the tomatoes with a potato masher, cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until thick and delicious, then tear in the basil leaves and season to perfection (I sometimes add a pinch of dried red chilli flakes too, for a kick).</li>
            <li>If you want to plump up your buns, pop them into a warm oven for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, finely slice or prep all the salad veg.</li>
            <li>Next, pick the basil leaves into a blender and blitz with all the other dressing ingredients and a pinch of salt and pepper until super-smooth.</li>
            <li>Place 2 teaspoons of oil in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Pick the rosemary leaves into the pan in four piles, place the patties on top and cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden</li>
            <li>Slice or grate the cheese, place on the patties, reduce the heat to low, then cover and leave to melt for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce into the buns, then sandwich the cheesy burgers and sliced gherkins inside</li>
            <li>Toss the salad with half the dressing (save the rest for another day), serve alongside the burgers and enjoy – totally awesome.</li>
        </ol>
